# Draconic-Evolution-Reactor-Simulation
Hi everyone, this project is a reimplementation of the Draconic Reactor from Draconic Evolution by Brandon3055 and is made in C++
The point of this project is so that you can safely and quickly simulate the draconic reactor and that allows you to do many things, including testing control software or itterating control values to stop your reactor from exploding.
